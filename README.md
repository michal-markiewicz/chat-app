## Chat App

This project was made because I was fascinated with WebSockets. I got a good grip on how WebSockets work and deepened my understanding of how communication works in general regarding web development. Some of the technologies I used are React, Next.js, Typescript, MySQL.  
  
There is definitely room for improvement. As I already have registration page for example I could also add login page aswell. Could improve styles too. But the goal of this project was not to do what I did many times but to learn cool stuff.
